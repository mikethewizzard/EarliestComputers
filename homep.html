                  The Antikythera Mechanism was in a ship which is assumed to be Ancient Greek and, when it sank just off the coast of Antikythera island in the middle of the 1st century BCE it
                  carried a huge number of artefacts dating back to as early as the 4th century BCE.

               Pascaline, also called Arithmetic Machine, the first calculator or adding machine to be produced in 
               <br>any quantity and actually used. The Pascaline was designed and built by the French mathematician
               <br>-philosopher Blaise Pascal between 1642 and 1644. 
               He built 50 of them over the next 10 years.

               Arithmometer, early calculating machine, built in 1820 by Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar of France.
               <br> Whereas earlier calculating machines, such as Blaise Pascal’s Pascaline in France and Gottfried
               <br> Wilhelm von Leibniz’s Step Reckoner in Germany, were mere curiosities, with the Industrial Revolution
               <br> came a widespread need to perform repetitive operations efficiently. With other activities being
               <br> mechanized, why not calculation? De Colmar effectively met this challenge when he built his
               <br> Arithmometer, the first commercial mass-produced calculating device. Based on Leibniz’s technology,
               <br> it could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and, with some more elaborate user involvement,
               <br> division. It was extremely popular and sold for 90 years. In contrast to the modern calculator’s credit-card
               <br> size, the Arithmometer was large enough to cover a desktop.
